# Game loop
# Done
## Decide who is the dealer in this round
## Show 4 cards on the table and give one card to dealer which is also seen to everyone
# Done
## Players in specific order decide which card will be their starting one with bet
## Bets can be different between players.

# Done
## In next round each player gets one card and decides if they are standing (Showdown) or drawing another one (Draw card)
## Some cards are hidden so other players (and dealer) can't determine what is exact sum of cards.
## After that dealer draws card and decides to stand or draw one more
## Then dealer compares each player's hand with his. If player wins then amount of his bet is given to him.
## If player loses then bet goes to dealer
